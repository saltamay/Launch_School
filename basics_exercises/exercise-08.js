// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

/**
 * var foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
 * foo.length;  // returns 3
 * foo[3];      // will this result in an error?
 */

// Answer: Yes it won't since that undefined is assigned to that element bt JS engine

var foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
foo.length;  // returns 3
foo[3];      // will this result in an error?
